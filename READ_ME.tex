This project is for everything to do with deformation theory, be it in the context of algebraic geometry, noncommutative algebra, quantum groups, or even anything else in between.

In regards specifically to quantum groups: ostensibly, these are representation-theoretic objects, but there is a lot of underlying algebra, geometry, and even (higher) category theory and homotopy theory at play. This project is for recording such details. For representation-theoretic facts, see:

Apr. 29th 2024: I'm not sure if D-modules should be included. They seem to live at the Lie algebra/classical level via things like Beilinson-Bernstein, even though it is often said that they quantise things like cotangent bundles. 

Dec. 20th 2024: I'm currently filing W-algebras under this project, since I now view them as deformation quantisations of certain nilpotent orbits that happen can be understood by representation-theoretic means, particular by actions of (affine) Yangians and toroidal QUEs.

May 24th 2025: Migrated W-algebras to quantum groups, filed under q-characters.
